The if __name__ == "__main__": idiom is particularly useful in Python when you have a script that can be used in two ways:

As a standalone script: In this case, the script is executed directly by the Python interpreter. This is typically when you want to perform certain actions, execute functions, or run tests defined within the script itself.

As a module: In this scenario, the script is imported into another script or program. Here, you might want to reuse functions, classes, or variables defined in the script without running the standalone behavior.

Here are some common use cases for this idiom:

Script with utility functions: You may have a Python script that defines a set of utility functions or classes that you want to use in other scripts. By using if __name__ == "__main__":, you can include code that executes only when the script is run directly, perhaps to demonstrate the usage of these utility functions or to perform some actions based on user input.

Script with test cases: When you have a Python script that contains test cases for functions or modules within the same script, you can use if __name__ == "__main__": to execute these test cases only when the script is run directly. This allows you to maintain tests alongside your code without executing them when the script is imported as a module.

Script with command-line interface: If your script is meant to be executed from the command line, you can define a command-line interface using libraries like argparse. The if __name__ == "__main__": block is commonly used to define the behavior of the script when certain command-line arguments are provided.s
